## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.
Make sure the vulnerability is real: Before reporting a vulnerability, 
make sure that it is a genuine issue and not a false positive. Try to replicate the vulnerability multiple times to ensure that it is not a one-off occurrence.

Identify the project maintainers: Look for the maintainers of the project, 
usually listed on the project's GitHub page or in the README file. 
If you can't find the maintainers, try reaching out to the contributors or the organization that owns the projecte.

Contact the maintainers: Once you have identified the maintainers, you can report the vulnerability to them via email, 
GitHub issue, or by opening a pull request. 
Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the vulnerability and any possible mitigations. 
You may also want to provide a proof-of-concept or a demo to demonstrate the vulnerability.

Be patient: The maintainers may take some time to respond to your report. Be patient and give them enough time to investigate the issue and develop a fix.

Follow up: If the maintainers do not respond within a reasonable time or do not take action to fix the vulnerability, 
you may want to follow up with them. You can also report the vulnerability to the relevant authorities or disclosure programs if necessary.

If your report gets accepted or declined we will contact you about this, the means will depend on the way you reported the issue.
